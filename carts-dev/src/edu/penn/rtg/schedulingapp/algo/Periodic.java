/**
 * Periodic Resource Model - Abstract Component Interface.
 * <P>
 * A component can be consisted of a set of sub-components or 
 * a set of periodic task. In case of a set of periodic tasks, we can consider 
 * them as a single periodic task which can schedule given periodic tasks. In case 
 * of a set of subcomponents, we can transform each component to single task. Then, 
 * we abstract them as a single task which can schedule all sub-components. 
 * In point of subcomponents, this single task can be considered as resource model 
 * supply certain amount of resouce allocation which is needed to schedule all sub-components.
 * <P>
 * (Periodic Resource Model)
 *
 * Periodic resource model guarantees resource allocation of \Theta time units every \Pi time unit, where 
 * a resource period \Pi is a positive integer and a resource allocation time \Theta  is a 
 * real number in (0, p].
 * <P>
 * computed Resource Model using abstract procedure is saved in component c
