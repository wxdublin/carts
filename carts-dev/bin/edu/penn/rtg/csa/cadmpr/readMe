Version 1.1
Modification: Change "CAMPR2hEDF" to "CADMPR". CADMPR is the term used in Meng's paper submitted to RTSS13. It was used as CAMPR2hEDF in the experiment.


CADMPR is the cache aware DMPR resource model, it uses the interface transformation of DMPR. 
The CADMPR_TASKCENTRIC uses the same SBF of DMPR, while the CADMPR_MODELCENTRIC uses the effective resource SBF which reduces the cache overhead from the SBF of DMPR. 
Because of the DMPR interface transformation and DMPR's SBF is better than that of MPR model.
The CAMPR interface is based on the following DMPR model and then incorporate the overhead into the analysis with two methods: task centric approach and model centric approach.
Step 1) It firstly calculates the DMPR interface of leaf component based on gEDF schedulability test used in Arvind's Journal Paper in 2009 about MPR.
Step 2) It transfers the leaf component's interface to (m'-1) full utilization tasks and one partial utilization task, which is DMPR's interface transformation.
Step 3) The parent component allocate a core to the full utilization interface tasks, which won't be abstract into DMPR interface any more. 
        The partial utilization interface tasks are abstracted to parent component's DMPR interface.
Step 4) Calculate each component's interface from bottom to top and get all component's interface.

The cache overhead is caused by the following three events:
a) The higher priority task release event;
b) The VCPU budget finish event;
c) The VCPU preemption event.

The task centric cache overhead accounting technique:
It inflates the cache overhead caused by the three events into each task's WCET. 
Then it does the overhead free scheduling analysis for DMPR.

The model centric cache overhead accounting technique:
Step a) Inflate each task's WCET with the cache overhead caused by higher priority task release event;
Step b) It reduces the overhead-free DMPR model's SBF by the cache overhead caused by VCPU stop event;
Step c) Do the schedulability test: The LHS is the inflated WCET's DBF, the RHS is the remaining SBF of the DMPR model.
 
 
=======================
Testing Satisfy the following requirement:	
It support the following situations: 
	a) multi layer components, i.e., nested components;
	b) component with empty taskset;
	c) component with task(not interface task) whose utilization is larger than 1; it will return infeasible interface in this situation.
	d) when the interface task has full utilization, the parent component can still have feasible interface. 

All non-leaf components should use "hybrid EDF" scheduling policy. The leaf component uses "global EDF" scheduling policy.
This is because the O.S. in guest domain only supports partitioned/global EDF.
