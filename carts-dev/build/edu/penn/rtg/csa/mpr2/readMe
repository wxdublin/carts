Tested! Satisfy the following requirement:
MPR2 is the MPR resource model proposed in Insik's MPR paper.
It support the following situations: 
	a) multi layer components, i.e., nested components;
	b) component with empty taskset;
	c) component with task whose utilization is larger than 1; it will return infeasible interface in this situation. 

All components should use "global EDF" scheduling policy.

There is no improvement for the transformation of interface to interface tasks. 
When the interface is transfered to a full utilization interface task, the parent component is hard to get a feasible interface.
This MPR2 implementation doesn't handle/improve this situation.

The MPR2_hEDF handle the full utilization interface task problem by directly pin the task to a core.
This task won't be scheduled by the scheduler any more when it has full utilization. 


    UPDATE:
    We can configure the program to use the fast schedulability test(Bertogna's approach) to check the DEM < SBF
    We can set the isFastCalculation = true in MPR2Analysis.java to use the fast calculation approach. 
    The drawback of Bertogna's approach is that the LHS of the feasibility test, i.e., DEM is larger than that in Arvind's schedulability test.
